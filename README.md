# Video-Object-Tracking-Kalman-Filter-Implementation
This repository contains my implementation of video object tracking and Kalman filtering using MATLAB. The project explores computer vision techniques to track objects in motion and predict their future positions, improving accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments.
